# **Isnads tagged automatically and disambiguated**

The same tags are used in both the automatic and disambiguated sets. For disambiguation, the texts were tagged automatically and then disambiguated as whole texts, moving the automatic tags to the place where the annotator thought was more appropriate.

# **Tags**
